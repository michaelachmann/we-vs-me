# we-vs-me – Usability Engineering Course Issue Tracker

## 📋 About This Repository

This is an **issues-only repository** for the Usability Engineering class. Students will use this repository to report usability issues, bugs, and observations while testing the **wevs.me** application.

> **Note:** *wevs.me* is a prototype created via **vibe coding** (using Lovable and Codex).  
> To read more about how and why the prototype was built this way — and the lessons I drew from it — check out my blog post:

## 🎯 About *wevs.me*

**wevs.me** is a questionnaire app that allows users to:

* Create and share short questionnaires
* Collect anonymous answers
* Unlock results only once **k participants** have responded

This creates an element of anticipation — results stay hidden until enough people have taken part.

The app was developed as part of an experiment in *vibe coding*, where AI tools like ChatGPT and Lovable were used to build a working prototype quickly. You’ll hear more about this later in the semester — for now, your task is simply to explore it as a user.

## 📝 Homework: First Exploration

1. **Visit the app:** Go to [wevs.me](https://wevs.me) and try it out freely.
   There are no specific tasks — just explore as if you were a new user discovering the app for the first time.

2. **Take notes:** Write down your impressions and observations.
   You might comment on:

   * What feels intuitive or confusing
   * What works well or breaks
   * Anything unexpected or unclear
   * Ideas or wishes for improvement

3. **Create GitHub Issues:**
   For each observation or problem:

   * Click **“Issues” → “New Issue”**
   * Add a short, descriptive title
   * In the description, include:

     * **What you tried to do**
     * **What happened**
     * **What you expected**
     * (Optional) steps to reproduce, screenshots, browser info

4. **Engage with others:**
   💬 Read a few issues by other students and **add short comments** — for example, if you:

   * Experienced the same issue
   * Have a different perspective
   * Can suggest a small improvement


## 💡 Example Issue Format

```
Title: Confusing layout when creating a new questionnaire
